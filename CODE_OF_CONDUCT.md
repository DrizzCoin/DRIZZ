# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, discrimination, or derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment, trolling, or personal attacks
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards and may take corrective action in response to unacceptable behavior.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers at [support@drizz.io](mailto:support@drizz.io). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Scope

This Code applies within all project spaces (e.g. GitHub, Discord, Twitter/X) and in public spaces when an individual is representing the DRIZZ project.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1.
